# Traffic-Light-Controller-using-8051-Microcontroller
A four way traffic light controller logic is implemented in 8051 microcontroller. 

The development board is created using a prefabricated PCB from Vegakit. I populated the PCB with all the required compoennets.

The simple arrangement of four-way traffic lights is setup using LEDs on a dot PCB board.
