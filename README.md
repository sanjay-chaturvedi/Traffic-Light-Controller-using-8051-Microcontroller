# Traffic-Light-Controller-using-8051-Microcontroller
## Hardware: Development Board and Symbolic Traffic Light 
A four way traffic light controller logic is implemented in 8051 microcontroller. The development board is created using a prefabricated PCB from Vegakit. I populated the PCB with all the required compoennets. The simple arrangement of four-way traffic lights is setup using LEDs on a dot PCB board.

## Logic  Implementation in microcontrollers PORTs
The values of PORT in each of the state of traffic light is shown in the below image. During transition from one state to other, all four traffic lights go yellow for a defined duration.
